# SpringBoot
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".  We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.
[Spring Framework Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/) 

### Features
- Create stand-alone Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
- Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
- Help to resolve dependency conflicts (Maven or Gradle)

## Spring Boot Starters
A full list of the Spring Boot Starters can be found here [Spring Boot Starters](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using.build-systems.starters).
- A curated list of Maven dependencies
- A collection of dependencies grouped together
- Tested and verified by the Spring Development team
- Makes it much easier for the developer to get started with Spring
- Reduces the amount of Maven configuration
